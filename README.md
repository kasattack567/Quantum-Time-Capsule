# Quantum Time Capsule

Welcome to the **Quantum Time Capsule** project! This repository contains the code for a web-based application that simulates the concept of storing and retrieving messages across time using quantum principles.

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Quantum Time Capsule** is a unique web application designed to illustrate the concept of quantum time capsules. It combines principles of quantum mechanics with digital technology to create an engaging and educational experience.

## 🎯 Purpose


## 🌟 Features

- **Create Messages:** Users can compose messages to be stored in the quantum time capsule.
- **Retrieve Messages:** Users can view messages that were created in different times based on simulation parameters.
- **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly design with visual elements that simulate quantum effects.
- **Educational Content:** Explanations of the quantum concepts underlying the simulation.

## 🔧 How It Works

### User Interaction

1. **Creating Messages:**
   - Users fill out a form to compose a new message.
   - Each message is assigned a timestamp and saved in the system.

2. **Quantum Simulation:**
   - The application simulates sending messages through different time points.
   - Quantum effects are visualized through animations and interactive features.

3. **Retrieving Messages:**
   - Users input a specific time or date to retrieve messages from that period.
   - The application displays messages with contextual information about their time of creation.

## 📥 Cloning the Repository

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - On **Windows**: You can open Command Prompt by pressing `Win + R`, typing `cmd`, and pressing `Enter`. Alternatively, you can use Windows PowerShell or Git Bash if installed.
   - On **macOS**: Open the Terminal application from your Applications > Utilities folder.
   - On **Linux**: Open a terminal emulator from your applications menu or by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Copy the URL of your repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/kasattack567/quantum-time-capsule.git
     ```
   - Paste the command into the Terminal or Command Prompt and press `Enter`. This command will create a local copy of the repository on your computer.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - After cloning, you need to change into the directory where the repository was cloned. This is necessary to run subsequent commands that depend on the repository's context.
   - In the Terminal or Command Prompt, type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```bash
     cd quantum-time-capsule
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `cd` stands for "change directory".
     - `quantum-time-capsule` is the name of the directory created by the `git clone` command. Ensure you type the directory name exactly as it appears, including correct capitalization.
   - **Verification**:
     - To confirm that you are in the correct directory, you can list the contents of the directory by typing:
       ```bash
       ls
       ```
       (On Windows, use `dir` instead of `ls`.)
     - You should see files and folders related to the Quantum Time Capsule project, such as `package.json`, `src`, `public`, etc.

## 🧩 Installing Dependencies

1. **Install the Required Packages:**
   - With the Terminal or Command Prompt still open and in the `quantum-time-capsule` directory, install the necessary dependencies by typing:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This command reads the `package.json` file in the project directory and installs all dependencies required for the project to run.

   - **Explanation**:
     - `npm` stands for Node Package Manager and is used to handle JavaScript packages.
     - `install` tells `npm` to download and install all the packages listed in `package.json`.

   - **Verification**:
     - After installation, you should see a `node_modules` directory created in your project folder, which contains all the installed packages.
