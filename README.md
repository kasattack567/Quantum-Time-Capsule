# Quantum Time Capsule

Welcome to the **Quantum Time Capsule** project! This repository contains the code for a web-based application that simulates a time capsule experience, where messages are encrypted with RSA and can only be decrypted in the future once quantum computing has advanced enough to break the encryption.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The Quantum Time Capsule offers users a way to send messages encrypted with RSA, designed to stay secure until quantum computers reach the capability to decrypt them. This highlights both the robustness of RSA encryption and the fascinating possibilities of future quantum advancements.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Create Messages:** Users can compose and encrypt messages to be stored securely in the time capsule.
- **Future Retrieval:** Messages remain inaccessible until future quantum computing power can theoretically break the encryption.
- **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly design with futuristic elements to enhance the experience.
- **Educational Content:** Information about RSA encryption and how future quantum computing could impact cryptography.
