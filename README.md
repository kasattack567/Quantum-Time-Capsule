# Quantum Time Capsule

Welcome to the **Quantum Time Capsule** project! This repository contains the code for a web-based application that simulates the concept of storing and retrieving messages across time using quantum principles.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The **Quantum Time Capsule** is a unique web application designed to illustrate the concept of quantum time capsules. It combines principles of quantum mechanics with digital technology to create an engaging and educational experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose


## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Create Messages:** Users can compose messages to be stored in the quantum time capsule.
- **Retrieve Messages:** Users can view messages that were created in different times based on simulation parameters.
- **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly design with visual elements that simulate quantum effects.
- **Educational Content:** Explanations of the quantum concepts underlying the simulation.
